Insight Data Engineering Fellows Program - Coding Challenge

We'd like you to implement a text-based Blackjack program in one of the following programming languages: Java, Clojure, Scala, C, C++, Python or Ruby. There should be one player and one dealer. The dealer should hit until his hand value is 17 or greater. You should implement the basic actions of hitting and standing. Implementing the more advanced actions such as splitting is optional. The player should start with 100 chips and must bet at least 1 chip each hand.

Any additional game play features are optional, but welcome.
